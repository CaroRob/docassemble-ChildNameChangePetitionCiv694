question: |
  Petition to Change Child's Name (CIV-694)
subquestion: |
  Before beginning this process, you should consider the following:
  First, why is the change being sought? A name change is not an adoption. It does not change
  any of the legal rights or responsibilities between a parent and a child. It will not give any new
  rights to a stepparent. The name change cannot be used to avoid debts or disrupt the bond
  between one parent and the child.
  Second, will it be worth the expense and time involved? A person can use any name for most
  purposes, although the person’s legal name will need to be used for official business. The child
  can then decide after turning eighteen whether to seek a legal change.
  Third, do you have legal authority to seek the name change? It is rare for the court to allow
  someone other than a parent to seek a name change on behalf of a child. Both parents usually
  need to agree to the change. If one parent objects to the proposed change, unless the other
  parent has really good reasons and the court finds the change to be in the child’s best interest,
  no name change would be allowed.
  Fourth, if all you want to do is correct a minor error on the child’s birth certificate (such as the
  misspelling of the child’s first name), you can file an Affidavit For Correction Of A Record (form
  VS-608) with the Health Analytics & Vital Records of Alaska instead of using the court change of
  name procedure. The VS-608 form can also be used to add a first name if none was given at
  birth. The VS-608 correction procedure can be used only to make a record more accurate and
  complete.2 It cannot be used to make discretionary changes in first or middle names or any
  changes in the last name. If you were born in another state, you might want to check with the
  records office in that state to see if a similar process is available.
  If you do not have the consent of both parents to this change, it may be helpful to talk with an
  attorney.Before beginning this process, you should consider the following:
